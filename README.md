# CosmosImages
A Cosmos Image generator using Generative Adversarial Networks Using PyTorch

The model used is similiar to the Celeb face generator present in the pytorch tutorial, with a change in the dataset, architecture and hyperparameters.

The model after training generates such images, but there is no constraint on realism. This is due to the presence of unrealistic images in the dataset.
